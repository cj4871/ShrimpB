            <h2>Neo-caradina</h2>
            <p>Neocaridina shrimp are a favorite of many aquarists, due to their ease of care and vibrant colors. They come in numerous varieties that vary from red cherry shrimp, yellow shrimp, blue velvet shrimp, blue Pearl shrimp, snowball shrimp, rili shrimp, green shrimp, black rose shrimp and more. Neocaridina make great additions to any freshwater aquarium because they can help keep the tank clean by scavenging for food and debris. Additionally, they require minimal maintenance and are relatively easy to breed in captivity. To ensure proper health and coloration of your neocaridina shrimp, you should pay attention to water parameters such as pH level, temperature range, hardness levels and oxygen saturation levels. With the right conditions in place these little critters will thrive in your home aquarium!</p>

            <h2>Caridina</h2>
            <p>Caridina shrimp are a species of freshwater shrimp that are popular among aquarium enthusiasts for their unique appearance and behavior. These shrimp come in a wide range of colors and patterns, and they can add a striking and vibrant touch to any aquarium</p>
            <p>Caridina shrimp are typically smaller than their neocaridina counterparts and have more complex care requirements. They are sensitive to changes in water parameters and require specific water conditions to thrive. They prefer slightly acidic water with a pH of around 6.5 and require consistent temperature and water quality. They are omnivorous and feed on algae, biofilm, and other organic matter in the aquarium.</p>
            <p>Caridina shrimp can be more challenging to breed than neocaridina shrimp, and they often require specific conditions to initiate breeding behavior. However, once they start breeding, they can reproduce rapidly and create a thriving colony.</p>
